# Oaknut

Oaknut is a block theme designed to help you create Linktree-esque profile pages. Get up and running quickly with one of the 23 prebuilt theme styles, or create your own design with the 14 fonts and 8 button styles included in the theme. Oaknut is built to be fast, easy to use, and fun!

## Contributing
Do you have a bug report or feature request? Feel free to create an issue, and I’ll take a look at it. You can also create a pull request if you have a solution ready. 

Keep in mind that I maintain my themes in my spare time. Even though I deeply appreciate any and all contributions, I can’t guarantee I’ll take a look at them quickly.
